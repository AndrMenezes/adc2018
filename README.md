## Logistic Regression Applied in Real Problems

Joint work with my great friend and data scientist [Wesley Furriel](https://github.com/WOLFurriell).

We used data colleted from surveys related to public opinion of brazilian citizens to applied the logistic regression model to real problems.

First, we investigated if the religion and scholarity influence the person's opinion to believe that the abortion is justified.
The data colleted from [Latin American Public Opinion Project](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/) (LAPOP) was considered.

Finally, we studied the profile of citizens who consider the corruption the big problem of Brazil. Data from [CESOP](https://www.cesop.unicamp.br/eng/banco_de_dados/v/4253) was used.
